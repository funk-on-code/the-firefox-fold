## What this is ....

A repository to keep my chosen Firefox browser hacks, plugins, .js files (**prefs.js / user.js**) and other bits and pieces.

## What this isn't ....

A one-stop shop to update **your** Firefox profiles. If, of course, you are setting up a *brand new* Firefox profile, you might get something out of this, but if things break, you get to keep all the broken pieces!
